        <p>
          The Semester Project... Yes! This project was quite stable and I were not focusing on it too much, though I should've spent more time adding
          the events to an API & create event specific pages. I mainly went over the page with Google Lighthouse and improved the SEO & accessibility.
          All my images were already below, or around 200kb, so I didn't touch these on this project. After getting the most important factors away, I
          went to moodle & read the feedback I recived. Reading it I found a few more improvements avaliable to do, with enough avaliable time, I
          added the changes.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="container__changes">
        <h2 class="container__title">Changes</h2>
        <p>
          The revamp includes changes to accessibility, user experience (changes to CTAs), contact form validation & sending, more consistency in
          styling (fixed margin on pages, instead of a % margin), adding error messages etc.
        </p>
        <div class="container__bullets">
          <h3 class="container__subtitle">Contact form</h3>
          <p>
            The largest change, is the contact form, which I connected to the Gamehub WP REST API 'Contact 7' plugin, with a different ID (so I'm able
            to differentiate the emails I recieve). Using the same script as the Exam & Gamehub, the user gets feedback if information is incorrectly
            entered &/or there's an error while sending. If the form is successful I'll recieve it on my email, and can reachout to the person sending
            it. (As mentioned in my Exam, I do not send a "confirmation" email, as the form can be filled out with any email.)
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container__bullets">
          <h3 class="container__subtitle">Prominent CTAs</h3>
          <p>
            The feedback mentioned my CTAs not being 'attention-grabbing', and I 100% agree. My buttons were bland and dissapeared into the
            background. They're now colored accordingly to the accent color (orange), and has a bold font weight. User will now be more attracted to
            the buttons, and there's a higher chance they'll end up in a flow.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container__bullets">
          <h3 class="container__subtitle">SEO & Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            Scared to destroy my project before my deadline, I mainly replaced some div's with 'section' blocks instead. The feedback also mentioned
            me having my list-items in an div instead of an ul/ol - so I changed it, it's now WCAG proof! I fixed my labels & inputs not being
            connected properly. Lastly aria-labels were added to all areas where applicable, mainly the menu logo, which redirects you to the home
            page.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container__bullets">
          <h3 class="container__subtitle">Other</h3>
          <p>
            Error & success stylings have been selected through 'red' & 'green' stylings, then going into inspect tool to find closest color with
            enough contrast. Font on contact form has been increased from 0.75 rem, to 1rem (16px). Scroll-behavior set to 'smooth', for a smoother
            experience. :rubberduck:
