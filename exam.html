        <h2 class="container__title">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Pretty much ignoring this project, as I wanted to focus on my cross-course project. That does not mean I made no changes! I did indeed read
          my feedback, and improved most that was mentioned. Though my logo is still wrapped in a H1 tag & my design has not been touched (but I
          promise, I'll challenge myself with the design next semester!). During the project most of the 'level 2' tasks were done, and it remains
          that way. I have not added a sorting system, which could be done by changing CSS flex styling (descending/ascending), or altering the API
          call (same as with css, but can sort categories & be more consitent).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="container__changes">
        <h2 class="container__title">Changes</h2>
        <p>
          The changes I've made are not crucial, and a few of them are actually bugs, like the "alt text" on my blog.html images & margin on social
          icons (on desktop view). The paragraphs should now be easier to read, with their max-width being declared. The technical parts have not been
          touched otherwise. Most time was spent creating this website, and I've implemented the H1 SEO improvement here.
        </p>
        <div class="container__bullets">
          <h3 class="container__subtitle">Text width limited</h3>
          <p>
            About page & blog post specific pages have their text max-width limited to 700px & 900px (Order left to right: About page, blog post
            specific pages). This was supposed to be in the main hand-in but apperantly I never added it - and became blind of my own work. Imporant
            to have people review your websites, both early and late, noted!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container__bullets">
          <h3 class="container__subtitle">Icons margin</h3>
          <p>
            The social icons have a beautiful nicely aligned margin, this was included in the original hand-in... But, I never added it! (Atleast for
            desktop, mobile had it). I therefor added a small 5px margin left/right on my exam project. It's not much, but it's just enough to make
            the icons breathe (more).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container__bullets">
          <h3 class="container__subtitle">Alt text</h3>
          <p>
            While making my blog feed, I used "alt text" as a placeholder, until the API was properly setup. This placeholder was never removed. Until
            now, the blog feed is now 100% (minus a few percentages) accessible! (Great job Dennis! - Thank you!)
