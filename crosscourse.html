        <p>
          To revamp the cross-course project was quite the task. Having spent approx 5 days designing & coding my portfolio page, a complete revamp
          would not be possible. The most crucial part of this project, is the store. So re-creating the API took some time, due to the shear amount
          of details I originally put in it. I have not touched the design much on this project, mainly adding styling to areas missing it. The
          project was quite the mess when I started, and therefor it became my focus area; to clean up the code.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="container__changes">
        <h2 class="container__title">Changes</h2>
        <p>
          The revamp includes changes to file naming, element naming (BEM naming), user experience (removing unused links), compressing images,
          improving javascript, improving accessibility, introducing the 'about' page, recreating the API, more consistency in styling, defering
          non-crucial javascript, adding error messages etc.
        </p>
        <div class="container__bullets">
          <h3 class="container__subtitle">BEM naming</h3>
          <p>
            This is the largest chunk I got done this week. I watched several YouTube videos on naming conventions for HTML & CSS, and decided to go
            for BEM naming. BEM naming does not give any large improvements to vanilla CSS, but in the future it might be easier - or by using SCSS.
            My naming has been poor on previous projects & therefor a lot of styles have had to be rewritten several times, I therefor tried to clean
            up naming & set a standard for my future namings. This was therefor mainly for practice, and I didn't quite finish all pages with BEM
            naming. Pages touched has their "max-width" media queries turned into "min-width" instead (focusing on mobile-first).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container__bullets">
          <h3 class="container__subtitle">Remove unused links</h3>
          <p>
            This wasn't as simple as removing a few anchor tags. My footer was fluttered with 10-15 tags that linked to non-existent pages. Sure they
            all linked to an error 404 page, but they were terrible for the user experience. If I went to a site like that, I'd leave within seconds,
            im sure of it. I removed my footer entierly, and remade it with a some simple copyright text instead. The sell page was something I never
            got to do, and after spending so much time on the BEM naming, I decided to replace it with an About page that follows the same design as
            the products page. Though the design 100% should've gotten a complete overhaul.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container__bullets">
          <h3 class="container__subtitle">Compressed images</h3>
          <p>
            The load time on my buy games page is quite long, having 4 different sections all load at once, with 3*6 games + 1 category with all 18
            games. Without having to touch the original design of the page, the only solution to decrease this load time, was to minimize the images.
            Therefor all images got compressed & converted to .WEBP format
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container__bullets">
          <h3 class="container__subtitle">Improved javascript</h3>
          <p>
            Using resources from previous projects & altering them to work with my project. This is the way the contact form was made & how my module
            files were made. Having finally learnt how to use the "import/export syntax" during the project exam, I saw no reason as to why I
            shouldn't use it on this project aswell. Using the import syntax made me able to clean up a ton of the javascript, making it a tiny tad
            easier to read & more expandable.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container__bullets">
          <h3 class="container__subtitle">Improved accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            I made sure to add some alt-text on 'ALL' images (where applicable), so that everyone knows what's being displayed. Images weren't the
            only concern. Having being introduced to Google's Lighthouse application by Kasper (during the our exam), it gave me a tremendous amount
            of information. All my anchor tags including links, yeah those were not really accessible, what's the narrator going to read? (the answer
            is nonsense). So adding aria-labels to my anchor tags was done on every single page. Including all links overlapping images which has no
            visual effect, but were linking to specific posts.
